            Home to about three million species of plants and animals, 
            the Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world. 
            At the current rate of deforestation, 27% of the Amazon will 
            be without trees by 2030.

              Beef and soy are the leading drivers of tropical deforestation 
              in the Amazon, comprising over two-thirds of the recorded habitat 
              loss. Increasing infrastructure, such as road building, has a large 
              indirect effect through opening up forests to settlers and agriculture. 
              This gives way to illegal mining and wood harvesting. This destruction 
              leaves a landscape of vulnerable degraded forests which are perfect for 
              natural forest fires. Overall, many of the effects from deforestation 
              simultaneously serve as causes of its continued devastation.

              The demand for soy and beef have increased rapidly over the past 50 years. 
              Since 1960, the areas used to grow both products have more than quadrupled.

          <h1>What Can be Done?</h1>
          <p>
            There are many ways you can directly make an impact towards reducing deforestation.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Reducing your use in wood, paper, oil and beef.
            Buying recycled products and continuing to recycle.
            Staying away from Palm Oil products. 
            Supporting companies committed to reducing deforestation.

            We as consumers carry the power to drive down demand for products contributing to
            deforestation. Without this demand, companies will reduce the supply and lessen the damage being done.

          <p>
            We are promoting awareness of deforestation to help conservationists
             in their fight against rainforest decay. This image recognition
             model trained on satellite images of the Amazon will be able to 
             determine the level of deforestation on new satellite photographs.
