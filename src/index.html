            Home to about three million species of plants and animals,
            the Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world.
            At the current rate of deforestation, 27% of the Amazon will

              <p>

                Beef and soy are the leading drivers of tropical deforestation
                in the Amazon, comprising over two-thirds of the recorded habitat
                loss. Increasing infrastructure, such as road building, has a large
                indirect effect through opening up forests to settlers and agriculture.

                This gives way to illegal mining and wood harvesting. This destruction
                leaves a landscape of vulnerable degraded forests which are perfect for
                natural forest fires. Overall, many of the effects from deforestation
                simultaneously serve as causes of its continued devastation.

          <p class="subHead">
            The demand for soy and beef have increased rapidly over the past 50 years.
            Since 1960, the areas used to grow both products have more than quadrupled.

              Despite promises to slow down the annually deforested area by the end of his term,
              President Jair Bolsonaro and his government have been heavily criticized for
              loosening environmental restrictions and constraining the work of regulatory
              agencies since taking office in 2019. Since Bolsonaro's arrival, deforestation and fire
              in the Amazon have risen to their highest levels in more than a decade.

          <p>Cultivation of
            soy and beef, along with fires and farming make up the leading causes to deforestation.
            Together they exist in a cycle of issues that are both causes and effects to deforestation.

        <h1>What Can be Done?</h1>
        <p>
          There are many ways you can directly make an impact towards reducing deforestation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reducing your use in products that contribute to deforestation is one way
          to help save the Amazon Rainforest. These products include wood, paper,
          palm oil and beef. Buying recycled products and continuing to recycle is also
          a great way to get involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          We as consumers carry the power to drive down demand for products contributing to
          deforestation. Without this demand, companies will reduce the supply and lessen
          the damage being done.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="aboutInsight" class="aboutSections">
        <h1>How This Works</h1>
        <p>
          We are promoting awareness of deforestation to help conservationists
          in their fight against rainforest decay. This image recognition
          model trained on satellite images of the Amazon will be able to
          determine the level of deforestation on new satellite photographs.
